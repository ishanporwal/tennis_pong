# Tennis Pong

## Project Summary
Our project centers around the classical game Pong. To give a litle bit of background, Pong was a groundbreaking electronic game released in 1972 by Atari Inc. It was one of the first video games created, quickly grew in popularity, and helped launch the video game industry. The original game is table-tennis themed and consists of two "paddles" on the sides of the screen that players use to volley a ball back and forth across a screen. We all enjoy playing tennis, so we were interested in creating a tennis themed version of the game, therefore, our goal for the project was to implement the game Pong with a start and end screen along with tennis related visuals such as the court as the background and rackets as the paddles. The genre of the game would be sports and the objective of the game is to block the moving ball from hitting your baseline while trying to get the ball to hit your opponentâ€™s baseline indicating a point scored. We've developed a one-player game with the opponent being a CPU. The game ends when either the player or CPU reaches a score of 5.
